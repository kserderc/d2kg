d2kg-OWL: An Integrated Ontology for Knowledge Graph-based Representation of Government Decisions and Acts

# d2kg scope
The d2kg ontology is a unique integration of existing ontologies combined with core and controlled vocabularies developed based on EU standards. It provides a customized solution to abide by the requirements of the Greek Programme Diavgeia, extending significantly the respective Diavgeia ontology and proposing
at the same time a solution to encode government and administrative decisions/Acts that could be universally adopted to integrate public documents produced by other EU Member States, with certain adjustments contentwise.
