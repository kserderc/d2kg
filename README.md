d2kg-OWL: An Integrated Ontology for Knowledge Graph-based Representation of Government Decisions and Acts

The d2kg ontology, in this respect, is a unique integration of existing ontologies combined with core and con-
trolled vocabularies developed based on EU standards. It provides a customized solution to abide by the require-
ments of the Greek Programme Diavgeia, extending significantly the respective Diavgeia ontology and proposing
at the same time a solution to encode government and administrative decisions/Acts that could be universally
adopted to integrate public documents produced by other EU Member States, with certain adjustments content-
wise.
